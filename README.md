# PACMAN
This project was created as a school project while learning C in APSC 143 and therefore may lack in certain aspects as it was required to meet the rubric standards.
The PACMAN code is entirely contained within the same files with multiple functions and is commented on for ease of reading.
The code communicates with a text file containing the current map, the map file updates after each user input.
